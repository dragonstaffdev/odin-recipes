        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3><em>Potato Buns Method</em></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine flour, potato flakes, yeast, salt, and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer. Whisk to combine.</li>
            <li>Add the water, milk, and eggs to the bowl. Begin mixing the dough, using a dough hook attachment, on medium-low speed.</li>
            <li>Once the dough has come together, increase the speed to medium-high speed, begin adding the butter one tablespoon at a time. Wait until each piece of butter is incorporated before adding the next until all of the butter is added.</li>
            <li>Continue mixing the dough for 5-6 minutes or until the dough is supple, elastic, and passes the ‘window-pane’ test.</li>
            <li>Transfer the dough to a large greased bowl. Cover the bowl and allow the dough to proof at room temperature for 1-1.5 hours.</li>
            <li>Once doubled in size, turn the dough out onto a well-oiled work surface. Divide the dough into 5 equal portions.</li>
            <li>Shape each portion into a round. Transfer the dough balls onto a sheet tray lined with parchment paper. Gently flatten each round with your hand.</li>
            <li>Cover the sheet tray loosely with a greased sheet of plastic. Once again, allow the dough to proof at room temperature for 45 minutes - 1 hour, or until puffed.</li>
            <li>Brush the buns with the egg wash and bake at 350 °F for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown and baked through.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3><em>Egg Wash Method</em></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine all of the egg wash ingredients in a small bowl. Whisk to combine them thoroughly.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3><em>Smash Burgers Method</em></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the meats in a large bowl. Mix them together by hand until all the meat varieties are well distributed.</li>
            <li>Form the beef blend into eight 4-oz balls.</li>
            <li>For the stovetop: preheat a large cast iron skillet with 1 tablespoon of oil over high heat. For the grill: preheat the grill to 500°F with a large cast iron skillet inside. Add 1 tablespoon of oil to the preheated skillet.</li>
            <li>Add two of the 4 ounce beef-blend balls to the skillet. Smash them with a very stiff metal spatula. The diameter of the patties should be about ½ inch wider than your bun to account for shrinkage.</li>
            <li>Continue cooking the patties on the first side for about 1 minute to form a crust. Then, flip the burger and cook for an additional minute. Season the other side of the patty with salt and pepper. Top each burger with a slice of american cheese.</li>
            <li>Transfer the cooked burgers to your burger bun and top with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, and special sauce.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3><em>Special Sauce Method</em></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine all of the ingredients in a small bowl, stir to combine with a small rubber spatula.</li>
            <li>Optionally, transfer the sauce to a squeeze bottle.</li>
            <li>Store the sauce in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.</li>
        </ol>
