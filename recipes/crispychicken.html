                <li>6-12 arbol chiles (optional)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl separate egg whites from 2 eggs and beat the whites until frothy. Add 3 Tbsp dark soy sauce, 3 Tbsp chinese cooking wine, and 3 Tbsp vodka. Beat together and set aside half for later use. In the same large bowl where half mixture remains, add ¼ tsp of baking soda and 3 Tbsp cornstarch, and whisk until smooth. Cut chicken into 1 inch pieces and add to mixture. Mix together by hand, making sure every piece is coated. Cover and set aside for about 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>In your shallow breading dish, combine 1 cup all purpose flour, 1 cup cornstarch, 1 tsp baking powder, and 1 tsp salt. Pour in 3 Tbsp reserved marinade and incorporate using your fingers until it’s clumpy. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Make the sauce: In a small bowl goes 4 Tbsp dark soy sauce, 4 Tbsp chinese cooking wine, 3 Tbsp rice wine vinegar, 4 Tbsp chicken stock, ¼ cup sugar, 1 tsp roasted sesame seed oil, and 1 Tbsp cornstarch. Whisk until completely smooth.</li>
                <li>From 6 scallions, thinly slice all whites and 2 inches of the green. Next grate 4 cloves garlic and 2 inches of ginger. In a saute pan over medium high heat, simmer 2 Tbsp vegetable oil and add most of scallions, grated garlic, and grated ginger. Saute for one minute. Add a dozen arbol chiles (optional) and saute for another minute. Pour in sauce and saute for one more minute until sauce has thickened.</li>
                <li>Heat a quart of vegetable oil to 375°F. Coat chicken in the breading flour mixture while it’s heating. Then add to frying oil one piece at a time and make sure not to crowd, cooking each batch for about 4 minutes. Place batches on wire rack that’s set on a rimmed sheet pan, and place in oven on low heat. Repeat until all chicken is fried.</li>
                <li>Add chicken to sauce mixture and coat over low heat. Serve with white rice and garnish with leftover sliced scallions. Enjoy!</li>
