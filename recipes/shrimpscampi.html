        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3><em>Simple Recipe Steps</em></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot ⅔  the way full with water and add 2 teaspoons of salt. Bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat the butter and olive oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet.</li>
            <li>Once the butter is fully melted, add the crushed garlic and red pepper flakes. Cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook until al dente according to the instructions on the box.</li>
            <li>Add the wine to the skillet and cook until reduced by half, about 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the shrimp and cook on each side for about 45 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add the lemon juice and stir to incorporate.</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta, but reserve ¼ cup of the water.</li>
            <li>Add the pasta to the skillet and stir to combine. If the sauce looks separated, add the reserved pasta water.</li>
            <li>Season to taste and garnish with parsley.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3><em>Complex Recipe Steps</em></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine 1 teaspoon salt and baking soda. Add the shrimp and toss to combine. Allow the shrimp to dry brine for 20-40 minutes at room temperature.</li>
            <li>In a small saucepot, add the wine, bay leaf, peppercorns, and reserved shrimp shells. Bring the wine to a simmer and continue cooking for 5-10 minutes or until the wine is reduced by half in volume. Then, turn off the heat, strain, and reserve until ready to use.</li>
            <li>Fill a large pot ⅔  the way full with water and add 2 teaspoons of salt. Bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, add 2 tablespoons of butter to a medium skillet. Heat over medium heat and once melted, add the breadcrumbs. Cook until the breadcrumbs are toasted, about 4-6 minutes. Reserve until ready to use.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, add the olive oil. Heat over medium-high heat until the oil is shimmering.</li>
            <li>Add the shrimp one at a time and cook for 30 seconds on each side, then transfer the shrimp to a separate plate. At this point, the shrimp will only be par-cooked.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic, red pepper flakes, and shallots to the same large skillet. Cook on medium-high heat for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add the reserved infused wine, reduce the heat to medium, and continue cooking for an additional 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, begin cooking the fresh pasta according to the package directions.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining 6 tablespoons of butter to the skillet. Allow the butter to melt fully, then add the lemon juice. Stir to combine the sauce.</li>
            <li>Add the shrimp back to the skillet to finish cooking.</li>
            <li>Taste the sauce for seasoning, then add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked pasta to the skillet directly from the pot, reserving all of the pasta water.</li>
            <li>Using tongs, stir the pasta into the sauce. Add ¼ cup of pasta water, then stir the pasta until the sauce becomes thick, glossy, and homogenous. If the sauce becomes too thick or separates, add another ¼ cup of pasta water.</li>
            <li>Finish the pasta with toasted breadcrumbs, fresh herbs, and lemon zest.</li>
        </ol>
